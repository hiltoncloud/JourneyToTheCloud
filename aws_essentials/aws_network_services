#												Aws Global infrastructure

# Regions are assigned to reduce latency between customers.
# Availabilty zones are physical data centers inside of regions. Regions have multiple availablity zones.

												Virtual Private Cloud
# A VPC is a private subsection of aws that the admin controls and you can determine what resources go inside of the VPC as well as who gets to use those resources.
# Network Access Control List (NACL) acts as the firewall for VPCS, Most websites operate on port 80 or 443 so if you needed your EC2 to scrap and pull from the web youd need to allow access to those ports.
# Subnets by default can talk to each other upon creation

												Internet Gateways(IGW)
#Internet Gateway: A combination of hardware and software that provide your private network with a route to the outside world (outside network)
# Automatically assigned an internet gate way and vpc upon creation
# Passes information from vpc to the internet acts like a modem basically connecting you to the outside network
# Internet gateways cannot be detached from VPCS with EC2s or RDS databases that are ACTIVE inside of them.
												Route Tables
# HAVING AN INTERET GATEWAY DOES NOT GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THE INTERNET.
# A route table contains a set of rules called routes that determines where traffic is directed.
# 0.0.0.0/0 means 'any traffic' can be directed to the destination of your choosing
# You can have multiple rules in your route table.
# TASK: "Create a Internet Gateway called "IGW"" , TASK: "Go inside of your route table and assign the 0.0.0.0/0 to the new internet gateway". TASK: Attach the "Custom IGW" to the default VPC.

												 Sub Nets
# Subnet is shorthand for Sub Network
# Think of a subnet has a smaller network attached to your Internet Service Provider.
# Public subnets have a route to the outside network (internet)
# Private subnets do not have a path to the outside network (internet) but it has a path to other instances inside of the VPC
# All subnets are automatically assigned to the "MAIN" route table which you can designate ut if i tnot it is already designated.
# Subnets that are assigned to a routetable that has no "0.0.0.0/0" or no Internet gateway. These route tables may only have "locaL (inside your vpc) desitnations"
# #TASK Create a ROUTE TABLE called Custom Route Table #TASK: ASSOCIATE TWO SUBNETS  TO YOUR NEW CUSTOM ROUTE TABLE. #TASK EXPLICITY assign the other 4 subets to our default route table.
# Quick Note: Public Subnets have an IGW attached basically a 0.0.0.0/0. Private subnets do not.
											Availability Zones VPC Specific
#High Availability means if the entire zone goes out you can swap to another availability zone and everything works fine.
#Fault tolerance is if a component in your network goes out but your network and system still works. For example imagine your internet gateway for some reason points to a black hole another igw should take over and become the new igw.
