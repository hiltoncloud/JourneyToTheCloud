#												Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
# Simple def: A computer on the AWS cloud.
# Operating system on EC2 = Amazon Machine Images or AMIS
# Instance Type = Process Powers (Free Tier)
# EBS Elastic Block Storage = Local Storage
# Network Access: Virtual Network Adapter gives us an IP ADDRESS
# Security Groups: Behave Like a fire wall or Network Access Control List
# Ram The same which is the memory of the EC2

^ These are the components of the EC2.

# 													Types Of Billing
# On Demand: Only charged when the instance is running.
# Reserved Instance: Purchase an instance for a set period of time you get a discount but your locked into the pricing.
# Spot Pricing: Bidding On instance you only pay when the insntance is below or at your bid price. Charged by the minute.

													Amazon Machine Image
# AMI is a preconfigured package required to launch a system that includes application,settings,software that you want inside of your image.
# ONE AMI can launch many EC2 instances this could be useful for quick scaling and bootstrapping.
# Community AMIS: Free to use , Generally with these AMIS you are just selecting the Operating System you want.
# AWS Marketplace AMIS: - Pay to use, Come packaged with additonal, licensed software
# AMI's you create yourself
#													Instance Types
# Instance = Central Processing Unit or CPU
# Each instance has different capabilities its basically the power of the cpu
													Elastic Block Storage
# EBS is a storage volume for an EC2 instances = equivalent to a hard drive
# IOPS = input and outputs. This means reading, writing and retrieval  of the data to the EBS storage. You can get faster "Input and Outputs or IOPS" Input and outputs per second.
# EBS volume size determines the amount of IOPS. So bigger EBS, is also faster EBS.
# EC2s start off with a root volume that is inside of the computer. If you delete the ec2 u also delete the ebs block unless u uncheck the delete on termination block.
# Additional volumes created are not deleted on termination of the ec2 instance
# Snap shots are backups of your EBS volumes.

												Security Groups
#Define: Security groups are similar to NACL, The difference is they are found on the "instance level" instead of the subnet level. Basically A firewall on the instance level.
#Security groups dont have numbers assigned to the rules. You also cannot create adn deny rules in the security groups.
#All inbound traffic is auto denied, All outbound traffic is allowed.
#Create a new security group and allow HTTP Web traffic.
#Security Group: Stateful any traffic that comes in is allowed to go outpound
#NACLS: Stateless without an outbound rule the trafiic would not be allowed to leave.

												IP ADDRESSING
# Providing an EC2 Instnace with a Public IP. A Public IP is NECCESSARY so that your ec2 instance can communicate with the internet.
# All EC2 Instances have private IPS, private ips allows your ec2 to communicate with all other instances inside your vpc by default.
# If you create a new vpc or subnet you have to enable public Ip address
# Task: Create an instance, inside the additional steps update the instance. #!/bin/bash;yum update -y; yum install -y httpd; service httpd start;
# Task: SSH: TCP Protocol, Portrange 22. Then allow webserver traffic through the HTTP by adding a service.
# Connect to EC2 instance using the domain service name which is a place holder for the ip address.
# ifconfig checks your network settings.
