I want to help you become is an M shaped
person, a good, solid generalised
foundation, so that's the top of the M. But with the ability
to become rapidly effective or
a specialist in the short term, with multiple
different disciplines. As an AWS Solutions architect,
your base general knowledge will be all
things AWS, your areas of specialty.
